This guide shows you how to create a user in an Omni instance with SAML authentication enabled.

Enable new user access to Omni in your SAML identity provider.

Make user login from the new user account.

Log into Omni using another account with `Admin` permissions.

Find newly added user in the list of users.

Now, select "Edit User" from the menu under the ellipsis:
