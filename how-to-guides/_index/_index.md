# Configure Okta for Omni

1. Log in to Otka
2. Create a new App Integration
3. Select “SAML 2.0”
4. Give the Application a recognizable name (we suggest simply “Omni”)
5. Set the SAML Settings and Attribute Statements as shown below:

6. Click “Next” and optionally fill out the Feedback, then click “Finish”

Once that is complete, you should now be able to open the “Assignments” tab for the application you just created and manage your users and access as usual.
